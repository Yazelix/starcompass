title: Thin orchestrator ownership
---

An orchestrator owns composition, lifecycle policy, compatibility selection,
and user defaults, not child mechanisms or state. Consume pinned child artifacts
through explicit contracts; keep translation narrow; reject copies, hidden
forks, and duplicate schemas. Expose startup, shutdown, update, and partial
failure policy, and test with substitutes when a child is unavailable.
